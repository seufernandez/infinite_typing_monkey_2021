# infinite_typing_monkey_2021 | 🖥️⌨️ 🐒

Hey Welcome to my Project!! I'm Gabriel Fernandes and I made this project during 2 days of code.

"The infinite monkey theorem states that a monkey hitting keys at random on a typewriter keyboard for an infinite amount of time
              will almost surely type any given text, such as the complete works of William Shakespeare."
              
              
And that is my project haha, @TypeMonkeyBot is a Twiiter Bot that every 30 minutes send a random message to humanity!

The Idea came from my friend Artur who had heard about that theorem someday and talked to me about create a BOT about it, 
and as this seemed pretty cool to both of us, and I am currently Studying JavaScript, I had to get the job.

And that's the project, if you want to you can take a look at the CODE up there, and I hope you liked :)
